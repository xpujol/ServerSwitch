ServerSwitch
============

A chrome plugin to switch a URL between servers

Installation
------------

As this isn't in the Chrome Plugins store, you'll need to add it to Chrome manually. This isn't hard though. 

As of Chrome Version 19.0.1084.52 on Mac OSX 10.7.3 and a few versions of Chrome on Windows 7 it goes like this:

- Click the spanner icon
- Click the "Settings" option
- On the left hand menu, select "Extensions"
- Ensure "Developer Mode" is selected
- Click "Load unpcked extension option"
- Navigate to the folder where you unzipped ServerSwitch and press the "Select" button

that's it, it should appear in the toolbar at the top next to the Omnibox. 
Whenever you pull down changes or update the code yourself you'll need to click the "Reload" link in the extension settings.

Chrome is always changing, so these guidelines may well fall out of date quickly, 
but Google never move the settings that far from where they were before
